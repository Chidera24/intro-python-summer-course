# Initial setup
This initial lesson will cover how to setup our environment for Python programming, we will be using the following programs:
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Google Collab (online)
- VSCode
- Git (and Github)

Requirements: 
- Working knowledge of computers, comfortable installing new software.
- No previous programming knowledge is required.

All installations from this section forward were made in a Windows 10 installation. Some installation instructions for macOS will be provided, but they will not be covered during recordings.

# Step 1. Installing Miniconda
Conda (or Miniconda in this case) is an open-source package management system and environment management that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can help you manage and install Python packages.

Miniconda is the smaller version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python and a small number of packages. For these lessons we will be using Miniconda. To install:
- Go to [Conda User Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).
- Download your appropiate installer for Miniconda from the Regular installation section and run the installer.
- Follow the setup wizard. Leave the "Advanced Options" as default. Click on "Install".
- Once installed you can search your system for "Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)". Open this app.
